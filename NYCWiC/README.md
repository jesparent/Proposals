## Working Abstract
This poster presentation highlights challenges and opportunities in various industries regarding ethical issues in the use and development as AI extends in its scope and function. 

From personal experiences in the fields of academia, information technology, cybersecurity, social work, entrepreneurship, and more;
interviews with those in other fields;
and as investigation into macro-level trends affecting North American economies, we discuss current and potential challenges. 

We represent a diverse range of participants across demographics of age, gender, sexuality, industry, experience, and technical expertise, but are unified in how technology will impact our future careers. 

Through this lens, we hope to offer a scouting report on how to effectively engage an ever-more-technical workplace with a more informed awareness of how to ethically engage in 21st century careers
